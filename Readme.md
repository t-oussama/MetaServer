# Introduction
MetaServer is a NodeJS web API that was made as part of a large project which was canceled. Since the code doesn't belong to any person or company execpt its author (myself), I am using it as a simple example of implementing a simple, abstract and generic CRUD API as well as its implementation in an actual web API.

# Technologies
* Nodejs
* Express
* MongoDb (communication using mongoose)

# Setup
The application is simple to setup and run. You just need to go to the project's directory and execute the following commands:
* npm i: to install all packages included in packages.json
* node index.js: to run the web server
